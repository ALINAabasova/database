# Database Course (PostgreSQL)

This repository contains my completed laboratory works for a university Database course. The labs demonstrate practical PostgreSQL skills from basic to advanced concepts.

* **Environment used:** PostgreSQL **16.2** on Windows 11, `psql` command-line interface
* **Work format:** Labs 3-7 documented with screenshots, Labs 8-17 as actual console transcripts
